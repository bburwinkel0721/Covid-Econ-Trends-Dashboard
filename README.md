# covid_project
## Project Overview and Goal
- The ultimate goal of this project is to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that will allow individuals to explore relationships between historic Covid-19 data and economical data for each state.
- To accomplish this task, we pulled in data from various sources, manipulate that data into a more usable format, created our own database with the desired structure, hosted that data using our own application, and then used that data to create a dynmaic online dashboard.
