# covid_project
## Project Overview and Goal
- The ultimate goal of this project is to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that will allow individuals to explore relationships between historical Covid-19 and economical data for each U.S. state.
- To accomplish this task, we extracted data from various sources, transformed that data into a more usable format, loaded it into a database with the desired structure, hosted that data using our own application programming interface, and then used that data to create a dynmaic interactive online dashboard.
